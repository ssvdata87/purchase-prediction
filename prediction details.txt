 A car company has just launched their brand new luxury SUV. 
And we're trying to see which of these users of the 
social network are going to buy this brand new SUV 
And the last column here tells If yes or no the user bought this SUV 
we are going to build a model that is going to predict 
if a user is going to buy or not the SUV based on two variables
 which are going to be the age and the estimated salary. 
So our matrix of feature is only going to be these two columns. 
We want to find some correlations between the age and the estimated salary 
of a user and his decision to purchase yes or no the SUV
